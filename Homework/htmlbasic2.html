          <p align="left">
            Below is a quick summary of the full rankings of all the playable
            classes in the game. While this gives a good outline of the
            standings of classes in comparison to one another, we recommend
            reading the full rankings to understand why certain classes are
            ranked as they are.

            <b>DEATH ON HARDCORE REALMS IS PERMANENT ON THAT REALM.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            This means that if you die, you won't be able to run back to your
            corpse and resurrect, nor can you be resurrected by any other spell
            or ability. This means that even if you have abilities as a part of
            your class, such as the Shaman Reincarnation, or Warlock Soulstone,
            they won't be of any use to you. You will continue to exist in the
            game world as a ghost to facilitate communication with in-game
            friends and resolve logistical matters such as handing over guild
            leadership if you are a Guild Master who has died an unfortunate
            death at the hands of a Defias Bandit or some other deadly creature.
            Your character is not necessarily lost if you die, however. After
            dying on a Hardcore realm, players will be able to choose to utilize
            the Free Character Move service and move their dead character to a
            non-Hardcore Classic Era realm. Once the move is complete to the
            non-hardcore realm, that character may resurrect as normal, but the
            way back to a Hardcore realm will be closed to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>PVP FLAGGING AND YOU</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Players will no longer be automatically flagged for PvP upon
            attacking another player. To flag yourself for PvP, you must type
            the command /pvp. You won't be able to take hostile actions against
            a flagged enemy player unless you flag yourself deliberately. We've
            added this failsafe to prevent situations in which a player could
            unintentionally take aggressive action against another player who is
            flagged for PvP, and unwittingly flag themselves. By requiring
            players to type /pvp before engaging in any PvP content, this
            maintains fairness and keeps PvP as a consensual part of the game.
            It will also reduce the likelihood someone will be “tricked” into
            becoming flagged unintentionally. It's important to note that
            attacking an enemy faction NPC will still flag you even if you
            haven't typed /pvp, so steer clear of settlements of the opposing
            faction!
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>PVP BATTLEGROUNDS AND WARFARE</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            PvP battlegrounds are completely disabled, as are all PvP
            Battlemasters. You may still enter premade Wargames, but you may not
            gain honor or PvP reputations from Wargames. While PvP is a fun part
            of World of Warcraft, by allowing players to enter battlegrounds on
            one-life characters, there is a concern that this would lead to
            overly defensive play, often to the point of non-participation,
            especially when you consider how powerful some rewards are from
            factions such as Stormpike Guard and the Frostwolf Clan. PvP is not
            the focus of the Hardcore game mode, so we've decided to disable
            normal PvP queuing entirely. If you wish to test yourself in
            pre-arranged Wargames, however, that's an available option. Wargames
            confer no honor or other rewards. Beware—if you engage in Wargames,
            death is still permanent
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>PVP AND QUESTS UPDATES</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Various quests and objectives that cause players to become PvP
            flagged, such as the quest, “The Attack” and, “The Missing
            Diplomat,” no longer cause players to become flagged for PvP. These
            quests were never strictly “meant” to flag you for PvP, but this was
            a result of how the creatures were set up at the time and was likely
            the result of an early technical limitation. We no longer have this
            limitation, and to prevent unintended consequences or “gotchas”
            after accepting an innocuous-looking quest, we've decided to no
            longer cause these quests to flag you for PvP combat. Various quests
            and objectives that require the player to die to complete or
            initiate the quest or objective may now be completed without the
            player's demise. While these quests are iconic and flavorful, the
            requirements of the character to be in a state of death is obviously
            problematic on a Hardcore realm. As a result, we've designed new
            ways to complete these quests without requiring your character to
            die or be dead to complete them. Many quests that require escorting
            NPC targets have been adjusted in such a way that most
            escort-related NPCs may no longer be attacked by players of the
            opposing faction. Many quest-related NPCs, particularly at low
            level, are very easily killed, and there's very little counterplay
            to a higher-level player of the opposing faction running up, killing
            your escort NPC, and running away. This is a vector for gameplay
            disruption that we don't feel has a place in the game, nor does it
            add anything meaningful to normal PvP combat.
